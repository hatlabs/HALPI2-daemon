## Introduction

[HALPI2](https://shop.hatlabs.fi/products/halpi2)
is a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 based boat computer. `halpid` is a power monitor and watchdog service for HALPI2. It communicates with the HALPI2 controller, providing the "smart" aspects of the operation. Supported features include:

- Blackout reporting if input voltage falls below a defined threshold
- Triggering of device shutdown if power isn't restored
- Supercap voltage reporting
- Watchdog functionality: if the HALPI2 receives no communication for 10 seconds, the controller will hard reset the device.
- RTC sleep mode: the onboard real-time clock can be set to boot the Raspberry Pi at a specific time. This is useful for battery powered devices that should perform scheduled tasks such as boat battery and bilge level monitoring.
- Power-cycling the USB ports: the HALPI2 can power-cycle the USB ports, which is useful if a connected device becomes unresponsive.

The main use case for the service software is to have the Raspberry Pi operating system shut down once the power is cut. This prevents potential file system corruption without having to shut down the device manually.

## Installation

TBD

## Configuration

The `halpid` daemon can be configured using a configuration file.
The default configuration file location is `/etc/halpid/halpid.conf`.

For example, if you want to change the blackout time limit to 10 seconds andthe poweroff command to `/home/pi/bin/custom-poweroff`, you can edit the configuration file as follows:

    blackout-time-limit: 10
    poweroff: /home/pi/bin/custom-poweroff

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Instructions

See the `run` script for common development tasks. The instructions below are for a generic `poetry` project.

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish üôÇ `poetry publish --build`

### Development features

- Supports for `Python 3.9` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/hatlabs/halpid/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/hatlabs/halpid/blob/master/setup.cfg).
- Automatic codestyle with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with code-formatting.
- Type checks with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io); docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint); security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
- Ready-to-use [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/hatlabs/halpid/blob/master/.editorconfig), [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/hatlabs/halpid/blob/master/.dockerignore), and [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/hatlabs/halpid/blob/master/.gitignore). You don't have to worry about those things.

### Deployment features

- `GitHub` integration: issue and pr templates.
- `Github Actions` with predefined [build workflow](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) as the default CI/CD.
- Everything is already set up for security checks, codestyle checks, code formatting, testing, linting, docker builds, etc with [`Makefile`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/Makefile#L89). More details in [makefile-usage](#makefile-usage).
- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) for your package.
- Always up-to-date dependencies with [`@dependabot`](https://dependabot.com/). You will only [enable it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates).
- Automatic drafts of new releases with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). You may see the list of labels in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.yml). Works perfectly with [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

### Open source community features

- Ready-to-use [Pull Requests templates](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and several [Issue templates](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- Files such as: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` are generated automatically.
- [`Stale bot`](https://github.com/apps/stale) that closes abandoned issues after a period of inactivity. (You will only [need to setup free plan](https://github.com/marketplace/stale)). Configuration is [here](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/.github/.stale.yml).
- [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U shrpid
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add shrpid
```

## Using with Conda

Conda users can setup a development environtment with ideas [stolen from Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71110028/2999754).

```bash
conda create --name shrpid --file conda-linux-64.lock
conda activate shrpid
poetry install
```

and during regular use:

```bash
conda activate shrpid
```

Conda environment can be updated as follows:

```bash
# Re-generate Conda lock file(s) based on environment.yml
conda-lock -k explicit --conda mamba
# Update Conda packages based on re-generated lock file
mamba update --file conda-linux-64.lock
# Update Poetry packages and re-generate poetry.lock
poetry update
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```
