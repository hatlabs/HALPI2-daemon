Description: HALPI2 service daemon
 `halpid` is a power monitor and watchdog service for HALPI2. It communicates
 with the HALPI2 controller, providing the "smart" aspects of the operation.
 .
 The main use case for the service software is to have the Raspberry Pi
 Operating System shut down once the power is cut. This prevents potential
 file system corruption without having to shut down the device manually.
